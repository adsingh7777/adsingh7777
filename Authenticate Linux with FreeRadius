**Authenticate Linux with FreeRadius**

To setup the Authentication against FreeRadius follow the following steps.

Step 1:- Clone the following repo for Pam module for freeRadius
https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/pam_radius.git

git clone https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/pam_radius.git

Step 2:- for Debian/Ubuntu distro run the following command

$ ./configure
$ make deb

The above command will build the code and output the debian package for installing the libpam-radius-auth 
$ dpkg -i ../libpam-radius-auth_2.0.1_amd64.deb

Step 3:- After installing the package move the pam_radius_auth.so file to the /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/security/ location

Step 4:- Configure the /etc/pam_radius_auth.conf file for pam authentication as followed

-----------------
# server[:port]             shared_secret      timeout (s)  source_ip            vrf
127.0.0.1:1812                   testing             3

-----------------


Step 4 :- SSH server configuration
To authenticate the SSH server request from radius server, edit the file /etc/pam.d/sshd.  Add a new line
auth                       sufficient                             pam_radius_auth.so
above the following line
auth                       include                                 system-auth


Step 5:- Password change configuration
Similarly, to change the password of any SSH user, change the file /etc/pam.d/passwd. Add a new line
password                            sufficient                             pam_radius_auth.so
above the following line
password                            include                 system-auth

Step 6:- After doing the above changes user will be able to authenticate into linux server using freeradius client.
